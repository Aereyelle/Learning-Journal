# Topic 2 – Introduction to Data Quality

## What this topic covered
- Key data quality dimensions: accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, uniqueness
- Why data quality matters (trust, decision-making, downstream impacts)
- Common causes of poor quality (human error, system issues, unclear definitions, integration problems)

## Key terms (quick definitions)
- **Accuracy:** data correctly represents reality
- **Completeness:** required fields are present (few missing values)
- **Consistency:** same data agrees across systems/tables
- **Timeliness:** data is up-to-date when needed
- **Validity:** data matches rules/constraints (e.g., date formats, allowed ranges)
- **Uniqueness:** no unwanted duplicates

## Notes / reminders for future me
- Add examples from real datasets I’ve worked with
- Add common checks I can reuse (nulls, duplicates, ranges, referential integrity)
